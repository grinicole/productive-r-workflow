## The Productive R Workflow course by Yan Holtz

This Quarto document showcases the skills I learned through the [Productive R Workflow](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com/) online course on efficient data analysis and report generation.

## Introduction 

![](asset/hex_sticker.png){fig-alt="An image showing the palmerpenguins hex sticker" fig-align="center" width=150} 


This document provides a straightforward analysis of the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset, which contains data for 344 penguins from 3 different species, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The libraries to be loaded for the analysis include `tidyverse`, `hrbrthemes`, `patchwork`, `DT`, `knitr`, and `plotly`.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes) # ipsum theme for ggplot2 charts
library(patchwork) # combine charts together
library(DT) # interactive tables
library(knitr) # static table with the kable() function
library(plotly) # interactive graphs
```





## Loading Data

The dataset has already been loaded and cleaned in the previous step of this pipeline.

Let‚Äôs load the clean version, together with a custom function available in `functions.R`.


```{r}
# Source functions
source(file = "functions.R")

# Read the clean dataset
data <- readRDS(file = "../input/clean_data.rds")
```



For this penguin data, `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` are measured as shown below:

![Bill measurement explanation](asset/culmen_depth.png){width=400}

In case you‚Äôre wondering how the original dataset looks like, here is an **interactive** version of it, made using the `DT` package:

```{r}
datatable(data, options = list(pageLength = 10), filter = "top")
```




## Bill Dimensions

Let's delve into some descriptive analysis, where we'll extract **summary statistics** and create **visualizations**.

Upon examination, one notable observation is the slightly **negative correlation** between `bill length` and `bill depth`:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="*Relationship between bill length and bill depth. All data points included.*"}
p <- data %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, shape = species)
  ) +
  geom_point(color = "#69b3a2") +
  labs(
    x = "Bill Length (mm)",
    y = "Bill Depth (mm)",
    title = paste("Surprising relationship?")
  ) +
  theme_ipsum()

ggplotly(p)
```



It is also interesting to note that `bill length` a and `bill depth` are quite different from one species to another. The average of a variable can be computed as follow:

$${\displaystyle Avg={\frac {1}{n}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}a_{i}={\frac {a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots +a_{n}}{n}}}$$

Averages of `bill length` and `bill depth` for each species are summarized in the 2 tables below:

```{r}
#| layout-ncol: 2

# Average bill length per species
bill_length_per_species <- data %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(average_bill_length = num(mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 2))

kable(bill_length_per_species)

# Average bill length for the Adelie species
bill_length_adelie <- data %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarise(average_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(species == "Adelie") %>%
  pull(average_bill_length) %>%
  round(2)

# Average bill depth per species
bill_depth_per_species <- data %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(average_bill_depth = num(mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 2))

kable(bill_depth_per_species)
```

For instance, the average bill length for the species `Adelie` is `r bill_length_adelie`.

To better understand how bill morphology varies, let's now examine the bill depth-to-length relationship within each `species`:

```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=9, fig.cap="There is actually a <b>positive correlation</b> when split by species."}
# Use the function in functions.R
p1 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Adelie", "#6689c6", 2)
p2 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Chinstrap", "#e85252", 2)
p3 <- create_scatterplot(data, "Gentoo", "#9a6fb0", 2)

p1 + p2 + p3
```



## Conclusions

This document provides a short analysis of the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset. The goal was to explore the relationship between bill length and bill depth and to show how important it is to consider group effects.
